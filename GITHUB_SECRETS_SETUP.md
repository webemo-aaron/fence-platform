   - Click on "Actions"

3. **Add the following secrets:**

### Secret 1: GCP_PROJECT_ID

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] GCP_PROJECT_ID secret added
- [ ] GCP_SA_KEY secret added (entire JSON contents)
- [ ] Deleted local gcp-sa-key.json file for security
- [ ] Ready to trigger deployment

## üîí Security Note

**IMPORTANT:** After adding the GCP_SA_KEY to GitHub, delete the local key file:
```bash
rm gcp-sa-key.json
```

## üåê Your Services URLs (once deployed)

After successful deployment, your services will be available at:
- Production: `https://fence-platform-xxxxx-uc.a.run.app`
- Staging: `https://fence-platform-staging-xxxxx-uc.a.run.app`
- Demo: `https://fence-platform-demo-xxxxx-uc.a.run.app`

Run `gcloud run services list` to see the actual URLs after deployment.
