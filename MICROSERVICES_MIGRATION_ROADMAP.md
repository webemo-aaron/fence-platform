# Microservices Migration Roadmap
## Enterprise Multi-Tenant Invisible Fence Platform

### Overview
This roadmap outlines the migration from the current monolithic invisible fence application to a modern, scalable microservices architecture on Google Cloud Platform with enterprise multi-tenant capabilities and AI-driven natural progression.

## Current State Analysis

### Identified Issues
1. **Build System Problems**
   - Missing package-lock.json causing Docker build failures
   - Heavy dependencies causing build timeouts
   - Monolithic architecture preventing independent scaling

2. **Architectural Limitations**
   - All services coupled in single process
   - Shared database connections and state
   - No service boundaries or independent deployments
   - Single point of failure

### Existing Assets to Leverage
- PostgreSQL databases (production, staging, demo) ✅
- Secret Manager configuration ✅
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline ✅
- Existing service logic in `/services/` directory ✅
- Multi-tenant middleware already implemented ✅

## Target Architecture

### Service Breakdown
The current monolith will be decomposed into the following microservices:

#### Core Services (Always Available)
1. **API Gateway** - Request routing, authentication, rate limiting
2. **Auth Service** - User management, JWT tokens, tenant management
3. **Frontend Service** - Static web application delivery

#### Tiered Services (Progression-Based Access)
4. **Customer Portal Service** - Basic customer management (Starter+)
5. **Pricing Service** - Quote generation, ROI calculations (Essential+)
6. **Notification Service** - Email, SMS, push notifications (Essential+)
7. **CRM Service** - Advanced customer relationship management (Professional+)
8. **Maps Service** - Google Maps integration, location pricing (Professional+)

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Fix current build issues and establish microservices infrastructure

#### Tasks:
1. **Fix Build System**
   ```bash
   # Generate package-lock.json
   cd /mnt/c/GCP/ServiceHive/src/invisible-fence-automation
   npm install
   
   # Create optimized package.json for each service
   # Remove heavy dependencies from individual services
   ```

2. **Create Service Structure**
   ```
   microservices/
   ├── api-gateway/
   │   ├── Dockerfile ✅
   │   ├── src/gateway.js
   │   └── package.json
   ├── auth-service/
   │   ├── Dockerfile ✅
   │   ├── src/auth-server.js
   │   └── package.json
   └── [other services...]
   ```

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**

## Migration Commands

### 1. Create Package Lock File
```bash
cd /mnt/c/GCP/ServiceHive/src/invisible-fence-automation
rm -f package-lock.json
npm install --package-lock-only
```

### 2. Extract Service Code
```bash
# Create service directories
mkdir -p microservices/auth-service/src
mkdir -p microservices/pricing-service/src
mkdir -p microservices/customer-portal/src

# Copy and adapt existing service code
cp services/auth-api.js microservices/auth-service/src/auth-server.js
cp services/quote-api.js microservices/pricing-service/src/pricing-server.js
cp services/crm-api.js microservices/customer-portal/src/portal-server.js
```

### 3. Create Service Package.json Files
```bash
# Generate lightweight package.json for each service
# Remove unused dependencies
# Focus only on service-specific requirements
```

### 4. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
cd terraform/
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="production.tfvars"
terraform apply
```

### 5. Build and Deploy Services
```bash
# Build each service independently
gcloud builds submit microservices/auth-service \
  --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/servicehive-f009f/fence-auth-service/auth-service:latest

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy fence-auth-service \
  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/servicehive-f009f/fence-auth-service/auth-service:latest \
  --region us-central1
```

## Service Communication Patterns

### 1. Synchronous HTTP Communication
- API Gateway → Service routing
- Service → Service direct calls for real-time data
- Authentication propagation via JWT

### 2. Asynchronous Event-Driven
- Pub/Sub for cross-service events
- Cloud Tasks for scheduled work
- Firebase for real-time notifications

### 3. Data Consistency
- Eventual consistency for cross-service data
- Distributed transactions where necessary
- Event sourcing for audit trails

## Rollback Strategy

### Emergency Rollback
1. **Traffic Routing**: Switch API Gateway back to monolithic service
2. **Data Sync**: Ensure database consistency
3. **Service Shutdown**: Safely shutdown microservices

### Gradual Rollback
1. **Feature Flags**: Disable specific service features
2. **Traffic Splitting**: Gradually route traffic back to monolith
3. **Service Deprecation**: Sunset individual services

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: < 200ms for API responses
- **Throughput**: Support 10,000+ requests/minute
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime

### Business Metrics
- **Tenant Progression**: 30% tier upgrade rate within 6 months
- **Cost Optimization**: 40% infrastructure cost reduction
- **Development Velocity**: 50% faster feature deployment

### User Experience Metrics
- **Comfort Score**: Average > 0.8 across all tiers
- **Feature Adoption**: 70% adoption rate for new tier features
- **Support Tickets**: 50% reduction in technical issues

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Service Communication Failures**: Circuit breakers and retries
- **Data Consistency Issues**: Event sourcing and compensation patterns
- **Performance Degradation**: Auto-scaling and circuit breakers

### Business Risks
- **Customer Disruption**: Blue-green deployments and feature flags
- **Revenue Impact**: Gradual migration with rollback capabilities
- **Compliance Issues**: Security audits and access controls
